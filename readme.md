# MyLinqExamples

## Objective
This project demonstrates simple and practical examples of how to use LINQ queries in C# to efficiently manipulate data. The data used is in a JSON file and represents a list of people with various information.

## Structure
- `data/data.json` - Contains simulated data for the examples.
- `examples/` - Contains examples of how to use LINQ with selection, filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# editor.
3. Ensure that the necessary packages are installed (such as Newtonsoft.Json to read the JSON).
4. Run the examples in `examples/` to see LINQ in action!

## Examples
In the code, you will find LINQ examples such as:

- **Selection** - Choosing specific fields.
- **Filtering** - Filtering data based on conditions.
- **Sorting** - Sorting data.
- **Grouping** - Grouping data by categories.
- **Aggregation** - Calculating aggregate values like sum and average.
